# DSAC-Project-1
Project Description

The project has three phases:

 1. Biodiversity maps for the general use of the biodiversity community using data provided by kaggle. This will show "biodiversity hotspots" areas of greatest             interest to the researchers and conservationists.

 2. Similar maps for specific demonstration cases in various regions of marines,territory and freshwater level.

 3. A very exciting project related to anticipating the impact of climate change on various species. This will inform you the world protected and non protected             resources of the world and how important that we have to protect the natural resources.
